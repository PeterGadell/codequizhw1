# codequizhw1
This is the code quiz homework. The Css file is linked internally useing the <style> tag. I added the theme of baseball to the quiz because the Nats are world champs! And im gonna enjoy it the whole year! Especially because my Redskins are struggling so I need somthing to cheer about. The javascript is linked at the bottom of the page like we learned in class. In the javascript file an intervalid was used. an array was coded for the questions,  and  functions were used to start the game, countdown the timer, keep score and display results. The material for the questions came from the book "Javascript & Jquery Interactive Front End Web Development" I tried to make the questions progressively harder as the code game went on to keep it fun. Hopefully whoever plays wins all 9 innings. Thanks!
